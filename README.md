I created the Car Market website. I used Javascript (React, Typescript, Redux), Tailwind (components are from DaisyUI) and NodeJs (Express). Ads data is saved on Mongo DB and images are saved on Cloudinary DB. The server is located on the railways.app website, so it may run slower at times.

The user can create, edit, hide and deactivate the profile. The user can also create, edit and deactivate the ad. Only the admin can permanently delete the profile and ad. Hidden ads are invisible to other users, and deactivated ads and profiles are visible only to the admin.

You can log in with demo profile, just go to log in (button at top right corner of the page) and there are login details for a demo account.
